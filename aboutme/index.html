      <p>Hello friends, let me first thank you for viewing my about me page.</p>
      <p>As written up above, my name is Owen Simbarashe Jakopo. I am from the South of Africa in a small land locked country called Zimbabwe. I live close to the capital Harare in a place called Chitungwiza, I really love it there notwithstanding heat, well I love the sun.</p>
      <p>I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and I have been for as long as I can remember. I am 28 years old and I am very single. I had the priveledge to serve as a full-time missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the years 2013-2015, I loved my service and f I could, I would do it again... only better this time</p>
      <p>I am currently enrolled for an online degree with Byui, made possible by Byu-pathway worldwide and my major is Applied Technology. I love filmmaking, I love telling stories with the lense for a friend of likes saying the words, "If it's not on camera, it never happened!" Haha! Cool huh!</p>
      <p>I am so excited about being in school, it's a dream come true for me. I look forward to learning and working with you.</p>
