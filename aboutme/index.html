      <p>Hello friends, let me first thank you for viewing my about me page.</p>
      <p>As written up above, my name is Owen Simbarashe Jakopo. I am from the<br> South of Africa in a small land locked country called Zimbabwe. I currently<br> live in Mashonaland west, in Chinhoyi, I really love it there notwithstanding<br>the heat, well I love the sun.</p>
      <p>I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and I have<br> been for as long as I can remember. I am 28 years old and I am very single. I<br> had the priveledge to serve as a full-time missionary for the Church of Jesus <br>Christ of Latter-day Saints in the years 2013-2015, I loved my service and if I <br>could, I would do it again... only better this time</p>
      <p>I am currently enrolled for an online degree with Byui, made possible by Byu-<br>pathway worldwide and my major is Applied Technology. I love filmmaking, I <br>love telling stories with the lense for a friend of likes saying the words, "If it's <br>not on camera, it never happened!" Haha! Cool huh!</p>
      <p>I am so excited about being in school, it's a dream come true for me. I look for-<br>ward to learning and working with you.</p>
