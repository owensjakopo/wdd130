            <p>My name is owen Simbarashe Jakopo, I am from Zimbabwe and I am currently staying in Chinhoyi, in mashonaland west. I am a student at BYUi, enrolled for an online degree. I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day saints, I served as a full time missionary for the church for two years and during this time of service, I found great stories of sacrifice, dedication, and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ which helped me strengthen my own testimony. That is exactly what this site is for, for we want to share with the world, real life stories, experiences and testimonies of, but not limited to the members of the Church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints in various parts of the world, both young and old, male or female. Imagine what your own story of faith can do to others out there. Send us an email with your story, and we will share it with world for if these stories are not recorded, they never happened! The History of the members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day saints, our stories, our testimonies, our greatest treasures!</p>
            <p>The stories I heard, that were shared with me during my mission insipred this website. This site does not talk about the history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day saints or any other church. What it does is, it contains the stories of the members, and many other non-members as well. It's pursose is to be a friend, offering comfort to they that cry, providing answers to those that seek, giving hope to many that stand in need of such. We are confident that the people that will visit our site will want to see more, or stay because ours are real lived stories and experiences. Send us your story here and we will share it with world for you. Write us an email with your story, you may also add an image of yourself.
