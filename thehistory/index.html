            <h2>The History</h2>
            <p>Have you ever heard a story that touched your heart that somehow you felt like the people who shared the story were angels, sent from heaven, just for you? In that regard, welcome, to the history of the members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Out there are people waiting to be motivated, to be given hope and assurance that they are not alone in their proplems, worries, care, and sorrow. your story, or that of another you know might just be what they need and they are counting on you to share, counting on you to give them hope but they don't know it yet and they do not know where to find you, and how.</p>
            <h2>Share with us, share with the world</h2>
            <p>That is exactly why we are here, the History is there for that purpose, to reach out to those who do not know where to look and how. With your inspirational stories of faith, humility, sacrifice and love, we can reach them together, and be agents in the hands of our heavenly Father. Our goal is to answer questions, strengthen one's faith, and hold a hand, help others find their way to the iron rod and also help them hold on, and never let go. Jesus Christ when he was on earth, He was followed by huge crowds. These people hungered for the truth and in turn, Jesus Christ fed them. One effective way Jesus Christ used in teaching the gospel was using parables, stories with Heavenly meaning. Your stories will do many wonders than you can imagine, so start typing.</p>
            <p>Ours is a friend, ready to cheer people up at any given time. Ready to listen to the history of the members of the Church of Jesus Christ of latter day Saints and all other faiths out there, and share with world their stories, their testimonies, their greatest treasures. The world will visit this site because the history of people shared here is not fictional, but real life stories, real experiences and you might happen to know some of the people and stories you will find here, stories you might relate to. The best thing about this site is that, you can access it on any device and anywhere at all, saving you the stress of carrying around a 400 paged novel.</p>
